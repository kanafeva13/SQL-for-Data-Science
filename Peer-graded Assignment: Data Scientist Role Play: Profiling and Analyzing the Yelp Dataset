Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
  i. Attribute table = 10000
  ii. Business table = 10000
  iii. Category table = 10000
  iv. Checkin table = 10000
  v. elite_years table = 10000
  vi. friend table = 10000
  vii. hours table = 10000
  viii. photo table = 10000
  ix. review table = 10000
  x. tip table = 10000
  xi. user table = 10000

SELECT 'Attribute table' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM attribute
UNION
SELECT 'Business table' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM business
UNION
SELECT 'Category table' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM category
UNION
SELECT 'Checkin table' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM checkin
UNION

    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM elite_years
UNION

    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM review
UNION
SELECT 'Tip table' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count

    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM user;

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
No, more reviews do not correlate with more fans.

        fans,
        review_count
FROM user

LIMIT 10;

+-----------+------+--------------+
| name      | fans | review_count |
+-----------+------+--------------+

| Roanna    |  104 |         1039 |
| Mimi      |  497 |          968 |
| Christine |  173 |          930 |
+-----------+------+--------------+

Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Having more reviews does not necessarily correlate with having more fans. Interestingly, among the top three users with the highest review counts, some have fewer fans compared to users with fewer reviews. This observation suggests that the number of fans a user has may be influenced by factors beyond simply the quantity of reviews they've written. Factors such as a user's perspective, lifestyle, and other variables could play a significant role in determining the number of fans they attract.

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
There are more reviews with the word 'love' (1780) than with the word 'hate' (232). 

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(text)
        FROM review
		    WHERE text LIKE "%love%") AS  'text with love', 

		    (SELECT COUNT(text) 
		    FROM review
		    WHERE text LIKE "%hate%") AS 'text with hate';

+----------------+----------------+
| text with love | text with hate |
+----------------+----------------+
|           1780 |            232 |
+----------------+----------------+

10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name,
      fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City: Las Vegas
Category: shopping

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT b.name, 
        b.city,
        c.category,
        b.stars,
        hours.hours,
        b.review_count,
        b.postal_code
FROM (business b INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id)
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = c.business_id

+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
We can see that both stores - 'Walgreens' and 'Wooly Wonders' are located in the same county (89121), and they both have rating below 4.0.
Businesses that have rating above 4.0 are located in different counties but they have similar working hours: since 8 AM until 4:30-5:00 PM.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
